Microtask is yet another little <b>Todo App</b> to get started with flutter and dart.  
It's currently in a <b>very early development</b> stage. So... I don't recommend using it for anything really.

Other than the learning aspect, it's aimed to provide a simple and fast to use interface for entering tiny tasks and increase productivity between meetings. 😏

Development is currently targeted towards Windows and will later experiment with the other flutter plattforms.

Language: https://dart.dev/  
Framework: https://flutter.dev/
